#LightWorld Editor
An editor for LightWorld-based levels in the LÃ–VE engine.

What is LightWorld? [This awesome library](https://github.com/tanema/light_world.lua).

#Features
- You can place rectangles and there is a temporary light to show that it is working.
- Heavily work-in-progress, so nothing else works yet.

#Planned
- Ability to save/load levels with custom lights and shadowbody objects.
- Ability to edit/remove lights/shadowbody objects.
- Module for saving/loading these levels (for your end-game, so you don't have to include the full editor).
